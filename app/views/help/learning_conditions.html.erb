  <p>This help page details how learning conditions work in <%= SITE_NAME %>.</p>

  <p>If you plan to partner with the research team, they will set up learning conditions for your class. If you aren't partnering with a researcher, you have the option to use the default learning conditions or to customize your own.</p>
  
<div class ="sectionHeading" id="overview_learning_conditions"><strong>Overview of Learning Conditions</strong></div>

<p>Learning conditions are rules that control how <%= SITE_NAME %> builds assignments and presents feedback. There are two (2) kinds of learning conditions:</p>

<p><em>Schedule</em> conditions define how OST builds and schedules exercises for assignments.</p>

<p><em>Feedback</em> conditions define when and how the site presents feedback.<%= link_to_help 'example_feedback' %></p>
     
<div class ="sectionHeading" id="default_learning_conditions"><strong>Default learning conditions</strong></div>

<p><%= SITE_NAME %> automatically sets default learning conditions for your class. As explained above, you can use the default conditions or create your own custom conditions. If you use the default conditions without making any changes, OST will build your assignments and present feedback as follows:</p>

  <%= render :partial => 'help/blurbs/default_learning_conditions' %>

<div class ="sectionHeading" id="overview"><strong>Overview of feedback conditions</strong></div>

<p>You can control the feedback students receive in several ways:</p> 
  
  <ul>
   <li>Apply different conditions to different <em>exercises</em>, e.g. show feedback differently for homework vs tests.</li>
   <li>Apply different conditions to different <em>experimental cohorts</em>.</li> 
    <li>Set feedback <em>timing</em>, i.e. when it becomes available and how long it stays available.</li>
    <li>Make viewing feedback <em>optional</em> or <em>mandatory</em>.</li>
    <li>Show students the feedback page <em>automatically</em> or require them to <em>manually</em> navigate to the feedback page.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>

<div class ="sectionHeading" id="labels"><strong>Understanding how to use labels</strong></div>
<p> must specify which feedback conditions apply to what exercises.
  <ol>
    <li>Create a feedback condition and assign it some arbitrary label.</li>
    <li>Attach that same feedback label to <em>all exercises you want to receive that feedback condition</em> <%= link_to "(as explained in this section)", "#attach_labels_to_exercises" %>.<br/></li>
    <li>Each additional feedback condition you create should have a different label.</li> 
  </ol>
  
<p>When a student completes an exercise, <%= SITE_NAME %> looks at the exercise labels and searches for a matching feedback condition label. When a matching feedback condition is found, its rules are used to determine how feedback is given. </p>

<ul>
</li><strong>Example 1</strong>: if a student completes an exercise labeled <em>Homework</em>, and there is a feedback condition labeled <em>Homework</em>, <%= SITE_NAME %> will apply the <em>Homework</em> feedback condition to that exercise.</li>
<p>
</li><strong>Example 2</strong>: if a student completes an exercise labeled <em>Test</em>, and there is no feedback condition matching that exercise label, <%= SITE_NAME %> cannot apply a feedback condition. The student will <em><strong>not</strong></em> receive feedback for that exercise.</li>
<p>
</ul>

<div class ="sectionHeading" id="create_edit"><strong>Create/Edit feedback conditions</strong></div>

<p>You can create any number of feedback conditions for your class. If you have created multiple experimental cohorts, you must create separate feedback conditions for each cohort.</p>
<em><p>Step 1: Create new feedback condition.</p></em>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <strong>Dashboard > Class > Learning Conditions</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the Feedback Conditions section, click <strong>Add New Feedback Condition</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the pop up dialog box, select <strong>Basic</strong> feedback condition and click <strong>Choose</strong>.</li>
  <li>You have just created an empty feedback condition.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Step 2: Edit feedback condition.</em></p>
  <ol>
  <li>Find the feedback condition you want to edit and click <strong>Edit</strong>.</li> 
    <%= image_tag("feedback7.png", {:border => 1, :width => "70%", :height => "70%", :title=>"new feedback condition"})%>
  <li>Complete the <strong>Feedback Condition Editing</strong> form:</li>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Match Labels Against field</strong>: The label you enter here must match the label of the exercise(s) you want to receive this feedback condition. (<%= link_to "Read more about labels.", help_learning_conditions_path(:anchor => "labels") %>) </li>
      <p>
      <li><strong>Feedback credit field</strong>: check this box to make viewing feedback <em>mandatory</em> for credit.</li>
      <p>
      <li><strong>Feedback presentation field</strong>: check this feedback presentation box to show students feedback automatically, or leave it unchecked to make students manually click on feedback page to view.</li>
      <p>  
      <li><strong>Set timing options</strong> by answering the prompts.</li>
      <p>
    </ul>
  <li>Click <strong>Update</strong> to save.</li>
  <li>Create as many feedback conditions as you need.</li>
</ol>

<div class ="sectionHeading" id="assign_labels_to_exercises"><strong>Assign labels to exercises</strong></div>

<p>Once you have set the feedback conditions for your class, make sure that you attach matching labels to the exercises each feedback condition will be applied to.</p>

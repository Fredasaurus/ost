   <p>Learning conditions are customizable rules that control how <%= SITE_NAME %> builds

  <ol>
      <li><strong>Schedule conditions</strong> control how OST builds and schedules assignments.</li>

   <p>When you plan assignments, decide which homeworks cover which topics and which

   <p>A cohort is a group of student that receives the same learning conditions. By default, a class comprises one (1) cohort.</p> 
   
   <p>The ability to create multiple cohorts is primarily intended for researchers running learning experiments. By creating 
   multiple cohorts, you can apply experimental conditions to different cohorts.</p>

<div class ="sectionHeading" id="overview_learning_conditions"><strong>Overview of Learning Conditions</strong></div>

<p>There are two kinds of learning conditions:</p>

<p><em>Schedule</em> conditions define when and how OST builds <em><strong>non-test</strong></em> assignments.</p>

<p><em>Feedback</em> conditions define when and how the site presents feedback (((add link to show in-line example_feedback))).</p>
     
<div class ="sectionHeading" id="default_learning_conditions"><strong>Default learning conditions</strong></div>

<p><%= SITE_NAME %> sets the following conditions by default:</p>



<div class ="sectionHeading" id="labels"><strong>Use labels to control when the site applies feedback conditions</strong></div>
<p>sdfgsddfgdjlkh must specify which feedback conditions apply to what exercises.
  <ol>
    <li>Create a feedback condition and assign it some arbitrary label.</li>
    <li>Attach that same feedback label to <em>all exercises you want to receive that feedback condition</em> <%= link_to "(as explained in this section)", "#attach_labels_to_exercises" %>.<br/></li>
    <li>Each additional feedback condition you create should have a different label.</li> 
  </ol>
  
<p>When a student completes an exercise, <%= SITE_NAME %> looks at the exercise labels and searches for a matching feedback condition label. When a matching feedback condition is found, its rules are used to determine how feedback is given. </p>

<ul>
</li><strong>Example 1</strong>: if a student completes an exercise labeled <em>Homework</em>, and there is a feedback condition labeled <em>Homework</em>, <%= SITE_NAME %> will apply the <em>Homework</em> feedback condition to that exercise.</li>
<p>
</li><strong>Example 2</strong>: if a student completes an exercise labeled <em>Test</em>, and there is no feedback condition matching that exercise label, <%= SITE_NAME %> cannot apply a feedback condition. The student will <em><strong>not</strong></em> receive feedback for that exercise.</li>
<p>
</ul>

<div class ="sectionHeading" id="create_edit"><strong>Create/Edit feedback conditions</strong></div>

<p>You can create any number of feedback conditions for your class. If you have created multiple experimental cohorts, you must create separate feedback conditions for each cohort.</p>
<em><p>Step 1: Create new feedback condition.</p></em>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <strong>Dashboard > Class > Learning Conditions</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the Feedback Conditions section, click <strong>Add New Feedback Condition</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the pop up dialog box, select <strong>Basic</strong> feedback condition and click <strong>Choose</strong>.</li>
  <li>You have just created an empty feedback condition.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Step 2: Edit feedback condition.</em></p>
  <ol>
  <li>Find the feedback condition you want to edit and click <strong>Edit</strong>.</li> 
    <%= image_tag("feedback7.png", {:border => 1, :width => "70%", :height => "70%", :title=>"new feedback condition"})%>
  <li>Complete the <strong>Feedback Condition Editing</strong> form:</li>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Match Labels Against field</strong>: The label you enter here must match the label of the exercise(s) you want to receive this feedback condition. (<%= link_to "Read more about labels.", help_learning_conditions_path(:anchor => "labels") %>) </li>
      <p>
      <li><strong>Feedback credit field</strong>: check this box to make viewing feedback <em>mandatory</em> for credit.</li>
      <p>
      <li><strong>Feedback presentation field</strong>: check this feedback presentation box to show students feedback automatically, or leave it unchecked to make students manually click on feedback page to view.</li>
      <p>  
      <li><strong>Set timing options</strong> by answering the prompts.</li>
      <p>
    </ul>
  <li>Click <strong>Update</strong> to save.</li>
  <li>Create as many feedback conditions as you need.</li>
</ol>

<div class ="sectionHeading" id="assign_labels_to_exercises"><strong>Assign labels to exercises</strong></div>

<p>Once you have set the feedback conditions for your class, make sure that you attach matching labels to the exercises each feedback condition will be applied to.</p>

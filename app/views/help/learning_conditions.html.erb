   <p>Learning conditions are customizable rules that control how <%= SITE_NAME %> builds 
   assignments and presents feedback. </p> 
  <ol>
      <li><strong>Schedule conditions</strong> control how OST builds and schedules
         <em>non-test</em> assignments.</li>
      <p>
      <li><strong>Feedback conditions</strong> control how and when OST presents
         <%= link_to_help 'example_feedback', text="feedback", {:title => 'Example Feedback',
         :width => '500', :height => '400'} %> to students.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>If you partner with the research team, they will set up  
    learning conditions for your class. Otherwise, decide whether to use 
    the default learning conditions or set up custom conditions.</p>  
   <% end %>
   
     <%= accordion_entry :title => "Default learning conditions" do %>

      <p>Unless you create custom schedule and feedback conditions, OST will build your assignments 
        according to the below default conditions.</p>
    <%= render :partial => 'help/blurbs/default_learning_conditions'%>
      <% end %>
      
      <%= accordion_entry :title => "Use the default learning conditions, or 
      create custom conditions?" do %>

      <p>Consider the following questions to help you decide:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><em>Massed practice or spaced practice</em>?</li>
        <p>The default condition enacts <strong>massed practice</strong>, which exposes students to each topic once.</p>
        <p>Create a custom condition to distribute homework exercises from each topic across multiple assignments.</p>
        <li>On what kinds of exercises or assignments should students receive feedback?</li>
       <p>Only on homework exercises? <strong>This is the default</strong>.</p> 
       <p>On homeworks <em>and</em> tests? Only some homeworks? Only some tests? <strong>These are custom
          conditions</strong>.</li>
        <p>
        <li>When should feedback become available?</li>
       <p>Immediately after a student completes the exercise? <strong>This is the default.</strong></p>
       <p>After a set interval of time? <strong>This is a custom condition</strong>.
        <p>

   <p>A cohort is a student group that receives the same learning conditions. By default, a class 
     comprises one (1) cohort. Unless you are designing a learning experiment, changing the default cohort 
     setting is <em><strong>not</strong></em> advised.</p>

    <p>Create multiple cohorts in order to apply different learning conditions to different cohorts, such as to 
      create experimental and control groups.</p>

   <p>You can create any number of feedback conditions for your class. If you have created multiple 
     experimental cohorts, you must create separate feedback conditions for each cohort.</p>
   <em><p>Step 1: Create new feedback condition.</p></em>
   <ol>
     <li>Go to <strong>Dashboard > Class > Learning Conditions</strong>.</li>
     <li>In the Feedback Conditions section, click <strong>Add New Feedback Condition</strong>.</li>
     <li>In the pop up dialog box, select <strong>Basic</strong> feedback condition and 
       click <strong>Choose</strong>.</li>
     <li>You have just created an empty feedback condition.</li>
   </ol>

   <p><em>Step 2: Edit feedback condition.</em></p>
     <ol>
     <li>Find the feedback condition you want to edit and click <strong>Edit</strong>.</li> 
       <%= image_tag("feedback7.png", {:border => 1, :width => "70%", :height => "70%",
          :title=>"new feedback condition"})%>
     <li>Complete the <strong>Feedback Condition Editing</strong> form:</li>
       <p>
       <ul>
         <li><strong>Match Labels Against field</strong>: The label you enter here must 
           match the label of the exercise(s) you want to receive this feedback condition. 
           (<%= link_to "Read more about labels.", help_learning_conditions_path(:anchor => "labels") %>) </li>
         <p>
         <li><strong>Feedback credit field</strong>: check this box to make viewing feedback
            <em>mandatory</em> for credit.</li>
         <p>
         <li><strong>Feedback presentation field</strong>: check this feedback presentation 
           box to show students feedback automatically, or leave it unchecked to make students 
           manually click on feedback page to view.</li>
         <p>  
         <li><strong>Set timing options</strong> by answering the prompts.</li>
         <p>
       </ul>
     <li>Click <strong>Update</strong> to save.</li>
     <li>Create as many feedback conditions as you need.</li>
   <% end %>
   
   <%= accordion_entry :title => "Use labels to control feedback conditions" do %>
   
   Use labels to control when the site applies feedback conditions
   <p> must specify which feedback conditions apply to what exercises.
     <ol>
       <li>Create a feedback condition and assign it some arbitrary label.</li>
       <li>Attach that same feedback label to <em>all exercises you want to receive that
          feedback condition</em><br/></li>
      <li>Each additional feedback condition you create should have a different label.</li> 
     </ol>

   <p>When a student completes an exercise, <%= SITE_NAME %> looks at the exercise labels 
     and searches for a matching feedback condition label. When a matching feedback condition
      is found, its rules are used to determine how feedback is given. </p>

   <ul>
   </li><strong>Example 1</strong>: if a student completes an exercise labeled 
   <em>Homework</em>, and there is a feedback condition labeled <em>Homework</em>, 
   <%= SITE_NAME %> will apply the <em>Homework</em> feedback condition to that exercise.</li>
   <p>
   </li><strong>Example 2</strong>: if a student completes an exercise labeled 
   <em>Test</em>, and there is no feedback condition matching that exercise label,
    <%= SITE_NAME %> cannot apply a feedback condition. The student will <em><strong>not</strong></em>
     receive feedback for that exercise.</li>
   <p>
   </ul>
   <% end %>
   
   <%= accordion_entry :title => "Attach feedback labels to exercises or assignments" do %>
   <p>Once you have set the feedback conditions for your class, make sure that you attach 
     matching labels to the exercises each feedback condition will be applied to.</p>

  <li>Check your spam folder for the email and confirm that that OpenStax Tutor is not being blocked by your email provider.</li>
  <li><%= link_to "Click here", new_user_confirmation_path %> and enter the email address you used when creating an account.</li>

<div class ="SectionHeading" id="change_section"><strong>I registered for the wrong section. How do I change to a different section?</strong></div
<p>
<p>If the instructor hasn't approved your registration request, you can change it yourself:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Go to <strong>Dashboard > Class name > Class Information</strong>.</li>
    <li>If your request is still pending, you will see the option to <strong>Cancel my request to join this class</strong>. Click Cancel and confirm your choice.</li>
    <li>On the same page, click <strong>Register</strong> to submit a new registration request for the correct section.</li>
  </ul>
    
<p>If you do <strong><em>not</em></strong> see Cancel my request to join this class, email the instructor and ask him/her to switch you to a different section.</p> 

<div class ="SectionHeading" id="multiple_choice"> <strong>I saved a free-form response, so why can't I view the multiple choice answers?</strong></div>

<p>In order to view the multiple choice answers, you must save and <em><strong>lock</strong></em> your free form response. If you save but don't lock your free form answer, you can work on other exercises or return to the assignment later, but you won't be able to view the multiple choice answers until you save and lock.</p>

<div class ="SectionHeading" id="late"><strong>I finished my assignment late. Can I still get credit if I work the exercises after the due date?</strong></div>

<p><%= SITE_NAME %> automatically withholds credit if you enter answers after the due date. However, final decisions about grading are ultimately up to your instructor.</p>

<div class="SectionHeading" id="fix_work"><strong>My hand slipped and I accidentally entered the wrong answer. Can I go back and fix my work?</strong></div>

<p>It depends. If you were working on the free form portion, and you saved but did not lock your answer, you can go back and update your work.</p> 

<p>If you saved and <em><strong>locked</strong></em> your answer, you cannot go back and change your answer. Similarly, if you confirmed your multiple choice answer, you cannot go back and change your answer.</p>

<p>Final decisions about grading are always up to your instructor.</p>

<div class="sectionHeading" id="change_student_section"><strong>My student registered for the wrong section. How can I change my student to a different section?</strong></div>

<p>If you are participating in a research study, check with the research team to find out if moving the student to another section will impact the student's assignments.</p>

<div class="sectionHeading" id="assignment"><strong>When I create an assignment, there is no place to add exercises. How do I add exercises to an assignment?</strong></div>

<p>To add exercises to an Assignment, attach the topic(s) you want the assignment to cover. <%= SITE_NAME %> will pull exercises from the topic(s) you list, in accordance with any learning conditions set for your class.</p>

<div class="sectionHeading" id="override_grades"><strong>I need to override the score OST assigned to a student. How can I do that?</strong></div>

<p>In certain cases, you can override the score OST assigns to a student on an individual exercise.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Go to <strong>Dashboard > Class > Class Information.</strong></li>
  <li>Scroll down to the list of assignments and click on the assignment in question.</li>
  <li>Click on the student's name.</li>
  <li>Under the exercise number, click on the student's score.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Make correct</strong>.</li>
</ul>
  
<div class="sectionHeading" id="add_resource"><strong>Can I add a resource to a topic after it has been assigned? Will students be able to access it?</strong></div>
  
<p>Yes, you can add a resource to a topic after that topic has been assigned. Students will be able to access it.</p>
  
<div class="sectionHeading" id="error_exercise"><strong>I sent out an assignment and realized there was an error in one of the exercises. Can I fix it?</strong></div>

<p>You may be able to edit the exercise in Quadbase and then click Refresh Exercises to update the exercise. In certain cases, you will not be able to use the Refresh Exercises feature. Go here to read more.</p>

<div class="sectionHeading" id="add_exercise"><strong>I sent out an assignment and realized it is missing an exercise. Can I add the exercise to the assignment?</strong></div>

<p>It depends. If students haven't yet begun the assignment, it may be possible to delete the assignment and send out a new one. Contact us. </p>

<p>Also, before you send out an assignment, it may be useful to go to <strong>Dashboard > Class > Learning Plan</strong> and click <strong>Preview Assignments</strong>. You can preview an assignment and make sure everything looks good beforehand.</p>

<div class="sectionHeading" id = "feedback_problem"><strong>I set up a feedback condition but students aren't receiving the feedback I'm expecting. What's going on?</strong>

<p>Some possibilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Check that your feedback condition is set up the way you expected. If you are expecting feedback immediately after an exercise is complete, but students receive feedback after the assignment is due, your timing settings may be the reason.</li>
  <p>
  <li>Verify that the labels attached to the exercises match the feedback condition label. Unless the labels match, the site won't activate your feedback condition. To verify:</li>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Go to <strong>Dashboard > Class > Learning Plan > Assignments</strong> and click <strong>Preview Assignments</strong>.</li>
      <li>Look at the labels attached to each exercise. </li>
      <li>Go to <strong>Dashboard > Class > Learning Conditions > Feedback Conditions</strong> and view the feedback condition labels.</li>
      <li>Verify that the exercise labels match the feedback labels.</li>
      <li>In this example, the labels clearly don't match, so the site will never show feedback for these exercises.<ul>
       
  <li>Verify that there is only <em>one</em> feedback condition matching the exercise label. If you have multiple feedback conditions with the same label, the site will apply the first matching condition.</li>

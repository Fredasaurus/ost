    <%= accordion_entry :title => "I saved my free-form response, so why can't I 
                                  see the multiple choice answers?" do %>
      <p>To view the multiple choice answers, you must save and 
        <em><strong>lock</strong></em> your free form response.</p>
        
      <p>If you save but
         <em><strong>don't lock</strong></em> your free form answer, you can work
          on other exercises, but you won't be able to view the multiple choice

    <%= accordion_entry :title => "Can I still get credit if I work exercises 
    after the due date?" do %>
      <p><%= SITE_NAME %> will not give credit for answers entered after the due 
        date. However, final decisions about credit for late work are ultimately up 
        to your instructor.</p>          
    <% end %>

    <%= accordion_entry :title => "I made a mistake in my assignment. Can I 
    fix my work and get credit?" do %>
      <p>It depends. If you saved but did <em>not</em> lock your answer, you can 
        change your work anytime before the assignment due date.</p> 
      <p>However, if you <em>saved and locked</em> your free form or multiple
         choice answer, you cannot go back and change your answer.</p>
      <p>If you unintentionally entered the wrong multiple choice answer, but 
        your free form work reflects the correct multiple choice answer, 
        you may want to check your instructor's syllabus about their policy. 
        Final decisions about 
        grades are always up to the instructor.</p>

    <%= accordion_entry :title => "How do I add exercises and resources to 
    #{SITE_NAME}? It looks I can only add links." do %>
      <p>OpenStax Tutor does not host course materials. The exercises you 
        assign must be hosted on <%= link_to "Quadbase", "http://www.quadbase.org" %> and 
        the resources you assign must be hosted on a website, such as <%= link_to "Connexions",
         "http:www.cnx.org" %>.</p>
        <p> Once your materials are hosted on external sites, you can simply copy
           and paste the URL in the Topics section.</p>
    <%= link_to "Click here to learn more about Quadbase, Connexions and adding materials to 
    the Topics section.", help_topics_path%> </p>
    <% end %>
    
    <%= accordion_entry :title => "When I paste an exercise URL from Quadbase into #{SITE_NAME},
     I can enter a question with a version number  or a question with no version number. What 
     is the difference?" do %>
        
    <p>A question with a version number is always accessible at the same URL. <strong><em>A 
      versioned question never changes</em></strong>, even if the author creates a new version.</p>
    <ul>
    <%= image_tag("versioned.png", {:border => 1, :width => "300px", :title => 
      "versioned"})%>
    </ul>
    
    <p>A question URL without a version number points to the <em><strong>latest version of the 
      question</strong></em>. As the author adds new versions of the question to Quadbase, <em>
        <strong>the question at this link will change</strong></em>.</p>
    <ul>
     <%= image_tag("unversioned.png", {:border => 1, :width => "300px", 
        :title =>"unversioned"})%>
    </ul>
    <p>Good to know:</p>
    <ul> 
      <li>Enter a versioned URL to use a particular version of an exercise.</li>
      <p>
      <li>Enter an unversioned URL to use the latest version of an exercise.</li>
      <p>
      <li>OST does not automatically synchronize changes made in Quadbase. If you add a question 
        to OST and later update that question in Quadbase, you must manually update the question 
        in OST. To refresh an unversioned URL, click Refresh Exercises. To update a versioned 
        exercise, paste in the new version URL.</li>
      <p>
      <li>Caution using an unversioned URL belonging to another author: they can create a new 
        version at any time. However, if the exercise belongs to you in Quadbase, only you can 
        create a new version.</li>

    <%= accordion_entry :title => "How do I add exercises to an assignment? It looks like I can
     only add topics." do %>
      <p>To add exercises to an Assignment, attach the topic, or topics, you 
        want the assignment to cover. <%= SITE_NAME %> will pull exercises from
         the topic(s) you list, in accordance with any learning conditions set for your class. </p>

      <p>If you are participating in a research study, <em><strong>check with
         the research team</strong></em> before moving a student to another

    <%= accordion_entry :title => "I need to override the score OST assigned to a

      <p>At this time, there is not a way to override points taken away due to 
        lateness or failure to view mandatory feedback. These features are coming soon.
         However, you can make a wrong answer correct by following these steps:</p>

    <%= accordion_entry :title => "I sent out an assignment and realized later there

      <p>You may be able to edit the exercise in Quadbase and then use the <strong>Refresh 
        Exercises</strong> feature to update the exercise. There are some limitations 
        to this feature, though. <%= link_to_help 'refresh_exercises', text="Click here to

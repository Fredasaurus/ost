<% faq_entry :section => 'Account FAQ',
             :question => "I created an account but never received a 
                           confirmation email. What should I do?" do %>

  <%= render :partial => 'help/blurbs/request_conf_email'%>

<% end %>

<% faq_entry :section => 'Account FAQ',
             :question => "How do I update my user settings, e.g. change my 
                           password / email address / time zone?" do %>

  <p>Sign in and click <strong>My Account</strong>, found at the top of every page.</p>
  <p>In My Account, you can update your password, email address and time zone. After you enter new information, enter your current password to confirm the changes.</p>

<% end %>

<% faq_entry :section => 'Student FAQ', 
             :question => "I registered for the wrong section of my class. How do I change to a different section?" do %>
  
      <ol>
       <li>Go to <strong>Dashboard > Class name > Class Information</strong>.</li>
       <li>If you see <strong>Drop this class</strong>, email your instructor and request he/she change your section.</li>
       <li>However, if you see <strong>Cancel my request to join this class</strong>, click Cancel and confirm your choice.</li>
       <li>Once you've canceled your registration request, click <strong>Register</strong> to submit a new registration request for the correct section.</li>
     </ol>

<% end %>

<% faq_entry :section => 'Student FAQ', 
             :question => "I saved my free-form response. Why won't the site show me the multiple choice answers?" do %>
          <p>To view the multiple choice answers, you must save and <em><strong>lock</strong></em> your free form response. If you save but don't lock your free form answer, you can work on other exercises, but you won't be able to view the multiple choice answers until you save and lock.</p>

<% end %>

<% faq_entry :section => 'Student FAQ', 
             :question => "Can I still get credit if I work exercises after the due date?" do %>
<p><%= SITE_NAME %> will not give credit for answers entered after the due date. However, final decisions about grading are ultimately up to your instructor.</p>

<% end %>

<% faq_entry :section => 'Student FAQ', 
             :question => "I made a mistake in my assignment. Can I go back and fix my work?" do %>
             
             <p>It depends. If you saved but did <em>not</em> lock your answer, you can go back and update your work before the assignment due date.</p> 

             <p>However, if you <em>saved and locked</em> your free form or multiple choice answer, you cannot go back and change your answer. In this case, let your instructor or TA know, as final decisions about grades are always up to the instructor.</p>

<% faq_entry :section => 'Instructor FAQ', 
             :question => "How do I add exercises and resources to #{SITE_NAME}? It looks I can only add links." do %>
             
             <p>OpenStax Tutor does not host course materials. Instead you will add course materials to, or reuse content from, Connexions and Quadbase. Once your materials are hosted there, copy and paste the URL of your exercises and resources into the Topics section. <%# <%= link_to "Go here to read more about adding materials to Connexions and Quadbase.", help_topics_path(:anchor => "add_content")%> </p>

<% end %>


<% faq_entry :section => 'Instructor FAQ', 
             :question => "How do I add exercises to an assignment? It looks like I can only add topics." do %>
             
             <p>To add exercises to an Assignment, attach the topic(s) you want the assignment to cover. <%= SITE_NAME %> will pull exercises from the topic(s) you list, in accordance with any learning conditions set for your class.</p>

<% faq_entry :section => 'Instructor FAQ', 
             :question => "My student registered for the wrong section. How can I change him to the other section?" do %>
             
             <p>If you are participating in a research study, <em><strong>check with the research team</strong></em> before moving a student to another section, as it may impact the student's assignments.</p>
             <p>

<% faq_entry :section => 'Instructor FAQ', 
             :question => "I need to override the score OST assigned to a student on an exercise. How can I do that?" do %>
  
  <p>At this time, there is not a way to override points taken away due to lateness or failure to view mandatory feedback. These features are coming soon. However, you can make a wrong answer correct by following these steps:</p>

             :question => "I sent out an assignment and realized later that there is an error in one of the exercises. How can I fix it? " do %>

<strong>Edit Schedule 1</strong>

<ol>
  <li>The first row <strong>(n=0)</strong> controls the current assignment:</li>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>Under <em>percent to draw</em>, specify what percentage of exercises OST should draw from each 
      topic attached to the current assignment.</li>
    <p>
    <li>Under <em>labels to apply</em>, enter comma-separated labels, e.g. to activate a feedback condition.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  <li>Click <strong>Add a new row</strong> if you want to include exercises from previously assigned topics.</li>
    <ul>
      <p>
    <li>For n=1 assignments ago, specify the percentage and label rules, if any, or leave blank.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
  <li>Continue adding new rows as necessary.</li>
</ol>

For row <strong>assignment n=0</strong>, designate what percentage of exercises OST should draw from each topic
 attached to the current assignment. 

  For example: if Assignment 1 includes Topic A, and Topic A has 4 exercises, a 50% rule will pull 2 exercises 
  from Topic A into the current assignment. 
  
Click Add a new row to create an additional percentage rule. 

  For example: If Assignment 2 includes Topic B, a 50% rule for Assignment n = 1 will pull 2 exercises from Topic A 
  (covered in Assignment n =1 ) and 2 exer f Assignment n = 1 is set to draw 50%  rule where all non-test
   assignments automatically draw exercises from <em>previously assigned topics</em>. 

Give Assignment n = 0 draws 50% of the exercises from topics attached to the current HW assignment; and 
Given Assignment n = 1 draws 50% of the exercises from topics attached to the <em>previous</em> HW assignment; and 
Given Topic A has 2 unused exercises, and Topic B has 4 unused exercises;
